# dior

Differentiable reparameterization of matrix orthogonalization in PyTorch. This is a side project that I developed while trying to implement sylvester flows.

"dior" stands for "differentiable iterative orthogonalization".

See `dior.py` and `example.ipynb`.

Legend:
- Red: target orthogonal vectors
- Blue: fitted orthogonal vectors (always orthogonal!)
